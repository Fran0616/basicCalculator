#the objective of this project is to evaluate a simple algebraic expression of two value. 
#float value to calculate
a = float(input("Enter a  value:"))

#float value to calculate 
b = float(input("Enter a  value:"))

# output the result of addition here
print("The sum is " + str(a + b))
# output the result of subtraction here
print("The difference is " + str(a-b))
# output the result of multiplication here
print("The product is " + str(a*b))
# output the result of division here
print("The quotient is " + str(a/b))

print("\nThat's all!")
